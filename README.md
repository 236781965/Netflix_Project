Exploring Netflix's Content: Insights from the Data ðŸ“ŠðŸ“º

This  sql project, I dove into Netflixâ€™s massive content library to uncover some interesting patterns and trends. My goal was to explore how content is distributed, how itâ€™s evolved over time, and to dig into things like ratings, genres, and cast diversity. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of what I did and what I found:

The Problem I Wanted to Solve:
Content Distribution by Country: How is Netflixâ€™s content spread across different countries?
Trends in Content Releases: Has Netflix been releasing more content over time? If so, how much more?
Content Duration: How long are movies, TV shows, and documentaries, and how does this vary by type?
Genre Popularity: Which genres are most common, and how have they changed over the years?
Ratings: How do ratings differ across content types, and how do they vary by country and genre?
Prolific Directors and Cast: Who are the directors and actors who have been the most involved in Netflix productions?
Content Availability by Country: Which countries have the most (and least) content available?
Diversity in Cast: How diverse are the cast members in Netflixâ€™s global content?

What I Did:
I used SQL to run a series of queries to look at Netflixâ€™s content from different angles, including:

Grouping and counting content by country, genre, type, and more.
Analyzing trends in content releases over the years.
Looking at the average duration of content (how long movies vs. TV shows are).
Tracking how ratings are spread across different types of content and countries.
Identifying the most prolific directors and actors on the platform.
Creating a heatmap-like view to compare how content is rated and available by country.

The Findings:
Content Distribution: Netflix's content is mostly concentrated in the US, UK, and India, while some countries have very few titles available.

Content Trends: The number of releases has increased a lot in recent years, especially as Netflix continues to expand its global reach.

Duration Analysis: TV shows tend to be shorter on average compared to movies, and documentaries generally run the longest.

Genre Breakdown: The most popular genres? Drama and Comedy lead the pack, but niche genres are growing over time.

Ratings: Movies and TV shows generally get higher ratings, but documentaries have more variety in their ratings.

Prolific Creators: Some directors are responsible for a lot of the content on Netflix, and certain actors keep showing up in a variety of genres.

Content Availability: The US has the most content available, but some countries (especially smaller ones) have far fewer options.

Diversity in Cast: The US has the most diverse casting, while other regions show different levels of representation.
